An entry point indicates which module webpack should use to begin building out its internal dependency graph.
Webpack will figure out which other modules and libraries that entry point depends on (directly and indirectly).

By default its value is ./src/index.js, but you can specify a different (or multiple) entry points by setting an entry property in the webpack configuration. For example in webpack.config.js file:

module.exports = {
  entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js',
};
