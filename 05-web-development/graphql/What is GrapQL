GraphQL is a new API standard that was invented and open-sourced by Facebook. Its goal was to solve issues related to efficiency and flexibility in client-server communication.

Key Features of GraphQL:
1. Declarative Data Fetching – GraphQL allows the client to specify exactly what data is needed, eliminating the problem of over-fetching or under-fetching data.
2. Single Endpoint – A GraphQL server exposes a single endpoint that handles various queries instead of multiple dedicated endpoints, as in traditional REST APIs.
3. Flexibility – The client defines the response structure, allowing it to be tailored to specific application needs.

GraphQL vs REST
REST, as an older API standard, introduced several best practices, such as:
- Stateless Servers – Each operation is independent and does not store information about previous requests.
- Structured Access to Resources – Data is organized around resources and accessed through dedicated endpoints.

However, REST is not a strictly defined specification – its concept was widely interpreted, leading to variations in implementation.

GraphQL was developed in response to the need for greater flexibility and efficiency in client-server communication, addressing key issues in REST:
- No More Over-Fetching – The client retrieves only the necessary data, avoiding redundant information.
- No More Under-Fetching – In REST, multiple requests (n+1 queries problem) are often required because a single endpoint does not return enough information. With GraphQL, all required data can be fetched in a single request.

GraphQL Type System
GraphQL has its own type system called Schema Definition Language (SDL). This ensures strong typing for the API, and every operation is validated against a predefined data structure.

Mutations in GraphQL
Mutations in GraphQL handle data modifications. The three main types of mutations are:
- Creating new data (Create)
- Updating existing data (Update)
- Deleting data (Delete)

Architectural Use Cases for GraphQL
GraphQL can be implemented in several ways, depending on system requirements:
1. GraphQL Server with a Database – A dedicated server that processes queries and mutations while directly interacting with the database.
2. GraphQL Server as an Integration Layer – Acts as a middleware to unify access to multiple systems and APIs.
3. Hybrid Approach – A GraphQL server that both connects to a database and integrates existing systems, creating a centralized data access point.
