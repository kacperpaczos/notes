Below is an example list of software testing types with brief descriptions:

1. **Unit Testing**  
   *Verifies the functionality of the smallest parts of an application, such as individual functions or methods, in isolation.*

2. **Integration Testing**  
   *Checks that different modules or components work together correctly by testing their interactions.*

3. **System Testing**  
   *Evaluates the entire system as a whole, ensuring that all requirements and functionalities are met.*

4. **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**  
   *Simulates real user scenarios by testing the complete workflow of an applicationâ€”from the user interface, through business logic, to the database or external systems. This helps ensure that all parts of the application work seamlessly together.*

5. **Acceptance Testing**  
   *Conducted to verify that the system meets the business requirements and expectations of the end users, often performed by QA teams, clients, or end users.*

6. **Regression Testing**  
   *Ensures that new code changes have not introduced unexpected issues into existing functionality.*

7. **Performance Testing**  
   *Assesses how the system behaves under specific loads. This includes load testing, stress testing, and scalability testing to ensure optimal performance under varying conditions.*

8. **Security Testing**  
   *Identifies potential vulnerabilities within the system to prevent unauthorized access and attacks.*

9. **Distributed Testing**  
   *Focuses on systems with distributed architectures where components may run on different servers or locations. These tests examine:*
   - *Communication between services*
   - *Resilience to network issues (such as delays or disconnections)*
   - *Data consistency across distributed environments*
   *The goal is to ensure that the system functions correctly even in complex, distributed setups.*

10. **Smoke Testing**  
    *A quick set of tests performed to verify that the most crucial functions of an application are working correctly before proceeding with more detailed testing.*

This list should help clarify the different testing approaches used in software engineering, especially highlighting what End-to-End (E2E) and Distributed Testing involve.
