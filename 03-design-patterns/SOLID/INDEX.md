## SOLID Principles Overview

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle - A class should have only one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed Principle - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle - Many specific interfaces are better than one general interface
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions

## Additional Design Principles

- **Composing Objects Principle** - Favor composition over inheritance
- **Principle of Least Knowledge** (Law of Demeter) - An object should have limited knowledge of other objects
